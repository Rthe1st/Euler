A n digit number added 10 times will have n+1 digits
(Becauing thats what timesing by 10 does)
Thus, adding 100=10*10 n digit numbers, gives us a n+2 digit number

Simple solution:
Start from small end, add each digit in column
This number will have 3 digits at most (4 if previous carry happened)
Carry the first 2(/3) into columns to the left
Repeat

Prematurly optimisaed solution:
Start from large end.
Add digits in each column, record sum
Move to the right and add, carrying any excess digits back to the right
Re-sum previous 3 columns to account for carrying
If carrying doesnt have a knock on effect (i.e. trigger carrying even further to the left)
for 3 columns in a row, you can early exit
As no column can effect a column more then 3 rows to the left of it.
